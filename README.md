  <summary>Answer:</summary>

   HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.

   HTML is used to:

   Structure content on a webpage â€” like paragraphs, headings, images, lists, tables, forms, and links.

   Define the meaning of elements â€” for example:

   `<h1>` to `<h6>`: headings

   `<p>`: paragraph

   `<img>`: image

   `<a>`: hyperlink

   Embed media like images, videos, and audio.

   Create interactive forms for user input.

   Provide semantic meaning for search engines and assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers).

   HTML is not a programming language.

   It's a markup language that tells browsers how to display content.
